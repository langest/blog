Jekyll is this awesome tool I'm using for this blog. I wanted to try and see what I could create with it and that is why I started this blog. Not sure what content I will fill it with, but probably some programming and some game related material.

At the moment I think it probably is more fun setting up the blog than actually filling it with content. Currently trying to get themes to work and change all the default settings.

In case you are interested in using Jekyll yourself, check it our [here](https://jekyllrb.com).

Update at the end of the day:
Managed to get links and descriptions in the main page in the blog. Next time I will try to customize the css and make everything look a bit better.
Also I might try to see if I can get some images into my blog.
