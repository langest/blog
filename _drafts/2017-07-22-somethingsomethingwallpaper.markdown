I had an interesting idea for ricing my desptop wallaper.
Usually when showing off you desktop you open an image to increase the style next to your fake busy desktop. I kinda like how this looks but it is inconvinient to have an image viewing software open at all times in the background. 
So my first idea was to just have the neat progrtam conky rotate some images for me but the first issue was that I needed to add a script to rotate images myself since conky doesn't support that. But I ran into a bigger issue. For some reason conky moves a few pixels every time i hide/unhide my menubar or move a floating window. (I use dwm, not sure if it is just my window manager)
So I decided that maybe I could write a script to attach an image to my wallpaper before setting it as a wallpaper, which would not need me to run conky in the bg at all. Since I would just use it for showing an image anyway.

Gimp to resize with batch jobs

imagemagick to make a composite out of them
